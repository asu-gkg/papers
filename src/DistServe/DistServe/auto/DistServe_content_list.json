The performance contrasts sharply when each phase is served independently on a separate GPU, shown by the orange and green curves, which achieve per-GPU goodput of 5.6 rps for the prefill phase and 10 rps for decoding. Ideally, by allocating 2 GPUs for prefill and 1 GPU for decoding, we can effectively serve the model with an overall goodput of 10 rps, or equally 3.3 rps per GPU, which is $2.1\\mathbf{x}$ higher than existing systems.

It reduces the execution time 3 , hence latency, particularly for TTFT of the prefill phase, but requires high bandwidth connectivity between GPUs (e.g., NVLINK). Inter-operator parallelism organizes LLM layers into stages, each running on a GPU to form pipelines.

In this paper, we reveal an additional benefit of model parallelism: reduced queuing delay of both prefill and decoding phases, steaming from shorter execution time.

First, if the chunk size is set much lower than the inflection point that can saturate the GPU, then the prefill job will have a longer execution time since it competes with the decoding job in the same batch and cannot solely utilize the GPU resources. Second, if we increase the chunk size to nearly saturate the GPU, the chance of piggybacking will diminish since the remaining slots for decode tokens are limited. Also, chunked-prefill causes significantly more memory access for the prefill jobs. This is because the KV cache of all previous chunks have to be loaded from HBM to SRAM repeatedly to compute each subsequent chunk. Concretely, if a prefill job is split into $N$ equal chunks, we need to load $N+(N-1)+\\ldots+1=O(N^{2})$ chunks of KV Cache in total, compared to $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ in the non-chunked case.

With this observation, we investigate how the latency and throughput change under different parallelism degrees under large batch conditions in Figure 5 : intra-op parallelism reduces latency with diminishing returns, caused by communication and reduced utilization after partitioning. Inter-op parallelism can almost linearly scale the throughput. Hence, when the TPOT SLO is stringent, intra-op parallelism is essential to reduce TPOT to meet latency goals.

Nevertheless, we discuss how they fit into DistServe. In DistServe, the FCFS policy can lead to a “convoy effect”, where longer requests block shorter ones in the prefill stage. Incorporating preemptive strategies, as suggested in existing literature [ 53 ], could enhance efficiency and is feasible within our system’s architecture. While not a primary focus in the current DistServe, fault tolerance is a critical aspect for consideration. In traditional colocation- and replication-based systems, a fault in one instance typically does not disrupt other replica instances. However, in DistServe, the dependency between prefill and decoding instances introduces the risk of fault propagation. For example, a fault in a single decoding instance mapped to multiple prefill instances could potentially cripple the entire service and cluster. We leave both as future work. ",

Figure 11 shows the performance of the four systems when serving OPT-66B on the ShareGPT dataset. \"vLLM $^{++}$ \"has the same performance as \"vLLM\" because we find the default parallelism setting (intra-op $\\scriptstyle=4$ ) has the best perGPU goodput. This further demonstrates the importance of disaggregation. The interference between the prefill and decoding phases significantly reduces the potential performance improvement through adjusting parallelism. In contrast, \"DistLLM-High\" can achieve further improvements over \"DistLLM-Low\" because it is not constrained by the deployment constraint that the prefill and decoding instance on one node should share the same model stage.

According to the results, DistServe scales well with the number of GPUs and is independent of the model size. This is because the simulator only simulates discrete events and the running time is the same no matter how big the model is. On the other hand, both algorithms are highly parallelizable, as the searches for different parallelism strategies are independent of each other, allowing the execution time of the algorithms to accelerate almost linearly with more CPU cores.

In such scenarios, the transmission overhead will increase as the size of the KV cache grows linearly with the prompt length. However, the prefill computation grows quadratically, so the relative duration of transmission and prefill job decreases. Meanwhile, a longer context further exacerbates the disparity in computational demands between prefill and decoding jobs, leading to increased interference between them.

Among them, Orca [ 54 ] introduces continuous batching to increase throughput. vLLM [ 32 ] proposes paged-attention for fine-grained KV cache management.

FastServe [ 53 ] implements iteration-level preemptive scheduling to mitigate the queuing delay caused by long jobs. However, they all employ a colocation approach for prefill and decoding processing, thus leading to severe interference. There are also concurrent works such as Splitwise [ 38 ], TetriInfer [ 27 ] and $\\mathrm{Deja}\\mathrm{Vu}$ [49 ] which adopt similar disaggregation idea to optimize LLM inference, further confirming the effectiveness of this method.
